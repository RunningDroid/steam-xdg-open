A fork of [xdg-open](https://github.com/freedesktop/xdg-utils) that backgrounds the process that it launches so it doesn't block the process that launched it, specifically [steam](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5090)

To use this copy [xdg-open](https://github.com/RunningDroid/steam-xdg-open/raw/master/xdg-open) to your local system, then add it to the PATH used when launching steam.
